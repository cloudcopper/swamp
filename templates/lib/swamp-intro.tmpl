        Swamp is a streamlined artifact storage solution designed for simplicity and
        efficiency, eliminating the need for an external database. It supports an 
        trivial UI and easily manages artifacts with customizable configurations.
        By using a YAML configuration file with anchors and aliases, Swamp lets users 
        manage their artifacts through a minimal, directory-based setup, with support for 
        metadata, retention policies, and validation.
    </p>
    <p>
        With Swamp, teams can set up a fully functional artifact repository with just a 
        few commands, making it ideal for projects where fast, straightforward storage 
        is key. Swamp continually monitors project directories for new artifacts and 
        automates key processes like artifact detection, checksum verification, and metadata updates.
    </p>
    <p>
        Uploading artifacts to Swamp is straightforward and can be done using standard file 
        operations like <code>scp</code>, <code>rsync</code>, or any other file transfer method. 
        Once files are copied to the designated project input directory, Swamp automatically 
        detects new artifacts, verifies checksums, and updates metadata, ensuring that artifact
        management remains efficient and hassle-free. This flexibility allows seamless integration
        with existing workflows, making Swamp a versatile choice for any project.

        Swamp is evolving to include new features that will expand its functionality and versatility.
        Upcoming releases are set to introduce web-based artifact upload capabilities, providing a more
        interactive experience similar to other artifact storage vendors. Additionally, Swamp is
        exploring support for alternative storage backends beyond the filesystem, with potential
        integrations for popular cloud storage solutions and database-backed repositories. These
        enhancements aim to make Swamp even more adaptable, catering to a wider range of project
        needs and deployment environments.

        It seems you have no repo configured yet. To get started with your first repository in Swamp,
        simply create a YAML configuration file named <code>swamp_repos.yml</code> in your project
        directory. Each repository entry should include basic fields like <code>name</code>,
        <code>description</code>, <code>input</code>, and <code>storage</code>. For example,
        define your first repository with a structure like:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
    project-id:
        name:        "Project Name"
        description: "Project description text text text"
        input:       /home/user/jenkins/swamp/project-id/
        storage:     /var/lib/swamp/project-id/
        retention:   1h
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        In this example, <code>input</code> is the directory where artifacts will be placed for
        Swamp to monitor, and <code>storage</code> is the destination for validated artifacts.
        After creating this configuration, save the file, restart Swamp, and it will begin tracking
        artifacts in your newly set up repository. Refresh the web UI to see your first repo in action!
